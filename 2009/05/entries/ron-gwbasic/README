10  GW-BASIC -- old school to the EXREME!!!
20
30  A simple algorithm for a simple language.
40 
50  After loading the map into memory it finds a + and changes it to a
60  marker character. Then it proceeds to scan the map from north to 
70  south changing each adjacent + to the marker character. Once it does a 
80  pass without any changes it selects a different marker character and 
90  repeats the process with the next land mass until there are no remaining 
100 landmasses.
110
120 Once it is done it counts all the different characters and prints out 
130 the result.
