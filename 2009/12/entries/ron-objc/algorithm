Pretty simple algorthm.

Read every line of a file and insert it into 2 lists
randomize the second list
iterate through the lists
    if any i exists such that list1[i] and list2[i] are the same family
        swap list2[i] with another random item in list2
        reset the iterator to the first item of the list and start again


There are quite a few base classes i had to write here. Turns out that the
base objective-c doesn't give you much (not even a nice object for a mutable
string or a nice list!) so I had to make them myself. Not part of the base
problem, but I was not going to wimp out and make it Mac-only.    

Note: gobjc is required.
