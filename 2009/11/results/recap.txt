The sea was angry that day...

11 combatants (+ bartbot) took to the field to vie for undisputed Rochambeau dominance.  There were tears, there was laughter, and Sheldon lost to bartbot.

The tournament got under way with an 11-round round robin to seed the top 8 for the finals.  Some highlights:

- Alex beats Nathan 7 to 5 with 488 ties
- Sheldon loses to the bartbot
- Darko beats Kobe 996 to 1, which is really impressive, but...
- Dave beats Kobe 493 to 0, the only non-bartbot shutout

In the end it came down to this:

Quarter finals:
Ron(1) vs. Lance(8) - Lance pulls off the revenge win by narrowly beating Fronto's 9 and 2 bot.

Darko(2) vs. Nathan(7) - Darko dominates completely.  Nathan's bot goes to a corner to cry itself to sleep.

Sheldon(3) vs. Kobe(6) - There was only one bot capable of beating Sheldon (well, besides bartbot), so his road ended here.

Dave(4) vs. Brooks(5) - Brooks's pattern bot couldn't hold back the Charlton tidal wave.

Semi finals.
Dave(4) vs. Lance(8) - Lance's happy ending is destroyed by the Dave-o-matic death machine

Darko(2) vs. Kobe(6) - Kobe couldn't even slow down the Darko Juggernaut as he mows down another

Bronze medal round:
Kobe(6) vs. Lance(8) - Lance can't handle the truth of Kobe throwing his own moves back at him, Kobe takes 3rd.

Championship Round.
Darko(2) vs. Dave(4) - Darko took 20 minutes to write his program, but it takes only 1 to take it all.

When the dust settled, it all shakes out like so:
