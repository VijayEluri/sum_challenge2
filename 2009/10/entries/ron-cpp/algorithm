basic algorithm. It's implmented a little differently from this to add a
bit of confusion, but this is basically it.

call fn(morse_code_in_bits, dict_check_command)

defun fn(v_input, dict_check, partial_word)
    cycles letter from a..z
        if letter matches beginning of v_input
            if (matches all of v_input && (!dict_check || in_dictionary))
                print partial_word + letter;
            else
                fn(v_input.remove_from_front(length of letter), 
                   dict_check,  
                   partial_word + letter)
            end
        end
    end
end
