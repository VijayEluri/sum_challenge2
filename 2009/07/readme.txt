More crunch time, so another easy one.  Your challenge this month is to take a letter of the alphabet and create a diamond.

Say what?

I think the best way to elaborate is a couple of diagrams:

Given the letter C, your program should output this:

  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A

For the letter E:

    A
   B B
  C   C
 D     D
E       E
 D     D
  C   C
   B B
    A

Have Fun!
