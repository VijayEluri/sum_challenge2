Program consists of a simple MSWord document with a VBA program.
The document consists of an input field and a button.
Enter in a value A-Z or a-z then press the button.

To be a little more quirky, it opens up Excel and produces the diamond there.  Perhaps this is the first competitor that uses 2 programs linked together to produce the results (ed. note: the second, case did another competition where a python program ran to produce a brainfuck program, which would produce the answer when run)

You may or may not need to change the security level of your MSWord to allow macros to run.
