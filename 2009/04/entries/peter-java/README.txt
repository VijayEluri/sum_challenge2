To compile:

javac -cp . WordChain.java

The parameters of the program are:
- first word
- last word
- dictionary
- "short" or "long"

NOTE: the timer need to be be modified to accomodate the last parameter, but this is fine according to the challenge rules.

To run:
./timer.rb "java -cp . WordChain" print cramp ./words.txt long
