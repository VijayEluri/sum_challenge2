Friends, romans, countrymen...

Summer is here, and with it comes the crunch time, so the June programming challenge is so simple, my six-year-old could do it!  Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to convert any integer from 1 to 4000 into its Roman Numeral representation.  

For example,

42 -> XLII
111 -> CXI
1337 -> MCCCXXXVII

Just in case you don't remember which letters go with which numbers, refer to this handy chart:

||Symbol||Value||
|I|1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|

Since you've probably already thought of about four ways to do this already, go type one of them out and submit it!  Any language, as long as I can run it from my machine here at work (that's right, I said *from*, not *on*, Fuchs)
