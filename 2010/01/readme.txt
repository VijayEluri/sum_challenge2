This months challenge is ridiculously simple.  Here's one solution:

{code}
perl -le '$_=q{Reverse this string};print scalar reverse;' 
{code}

But you know that isn't going to win, because who knows what crazy things people will do?  Maybe it will involve Minesweeper and the idle loop of a Commodore 64 emulator.  The possibilities are endless.

PS. Sending an email to James saying "Hey buddy, reverse this string" doesn't count as a program.
