February 2010 - These are the Days I Know

!garfield_dow.jpg|align=left,height=250,padding!

When printing out a list of days, it's nice to collapse it into ranges, so instead of Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun we'd see Mon-Wed,Fri-Sun.

This month's competition is to come up with the most interesting way to do that.  Basically, the only rules are...THERE ARE NO RULES!

Just kidding, there are rules, and here they are:

* The days of the week for this assignment, in order, are  Mon(1), Tue(2), Wed(3), Thu(4), Fri(5), Sat(6), Sun(7)
* Your program must take a list of numbers (not necessarily in order) somehow (stdin is usually the best)
* Two days alone are not a range (so Sat, Sun instead of Sat-Sun)
* Your program must then return the day range string.  

Some examples:
{code}
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -> Mon-Sun
1,2,3,6,7 -> Mon-Wed, Sat, Sun
1,3,4,5,6 -> Mon, Wed->Sat
{code}

I think you get the drift.  We'll give this one until Ron's favourite day of the year (St. Patricks' day) so that we have some time to make it happen!
