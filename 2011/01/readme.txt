!History of the world.jpg|height=300,align=left,hspace=5! If you've spent any time around graphics, statistics, or civil war re-enactments, you've seen a histogram. A histogram is just a graphical representation showing a visual impression of the distribution of data. 

Naturally there are rules for creating a proper histogram, and we will ignore pretty much all of them. You will be given a string of arbitrary length (note, could be really long) and you will create a very simple asterisk-based histogram showing the frequency of each character.

For example, using a simple character based mode, given this input: 

{code}
AAAABBBBAAAADDDDAAAA
{code}

You might produce output similar to the following:

{code}
A:************
B:****
D:****
{code}

As with all programming challenges, what language you use and how you display it are completely up to you, as long as you can give me instrutions on how I can build and run it.

Competition goes until the end of the month, so get started early for maximum chaos.
